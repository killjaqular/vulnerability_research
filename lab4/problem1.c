/*
Use the necessary tools to perform analysis of the compiled source code generated. Since we
are working in 32-bit use “-m32” for your gcc compilation options. For compilation I would
suggest using compiler option “-fno-stack-protector” and “-z execstack”. Please submit
write-ups of your analysis. Your points will be based on completeness of analysis, your
understanding of the problems, and if you were able to achieve the goals.

To compile:
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack problem1.c -o problem1

Problem 1: 5 pts
Compile the below program and run it. Who are you in this shell?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void main() {
    char *name[2];

    name[0] = "/bin/sh";
    name[1] = NULL;
    execve(name[0], name, NULL);
}
