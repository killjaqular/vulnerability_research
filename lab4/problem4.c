/*
Use the necessary tools to perform analysis of the compiled source code generated. Since we
are working in 32-bit use “-m32” for your gcc compilation options. For compilation I would
suggest using compiler option “-fno-stack-protector” and “-z execstack”. Please submit
write-ups of your analysis. Your points will be based on completeness of analysis, your
understanding of the problems, and if you were able to achieve the goals.

To compile:
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack file.c -o file

Problem 4: 20pts
Create a shellcode that will read a file called “flag” from the current directory. Use the program in
program 2 to test.
