/*
Use the necessary tools to perform analysis of the compiled source code generated. Since we
are working in 32-bit use “-m32” for your gcc compilation options. For compilation I would
suggest using compiler option “-fno-stack-protector” and “-z execstack”. Please submit
write-ups of your analysis. Your points will be based on completeness of analysis, your
understanding of the problems, and if you were able to achieve the goals.

To compile:
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack file.c -o file

Problem 3: 15 pts
Compile the below program; Cause a control flow deviation to a shell?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void func(char *name){
    char buf[100];

    strcpy(buf, name);
    printf("Welcome %s\n", buf);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    func(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
