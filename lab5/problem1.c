/*
Use the necessary tools to perform analysis of the compiled source code generated. Since we
are working in 32-bit use “-m32” for your gcc compilation options. For compilation I would
suggest using compiler option “-fno-stack-protector” and “-z execstack”. Please submit
write-ups of your analysis. Your points will be based on completeness of analysis, your
understanding of the problems, and if you were able to achieve the goals.

To compile:
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack file.c -o file

Problem 1: 5pts
Write a program that receives input and counts the number of bytes displayed to the screen
using a format string.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    unsigned count = 0;

    printf("%s%n", argv[1], &count);
    printf(":%d\n", count);

    return 0;
}
