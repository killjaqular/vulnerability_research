Assignment 2 of 2022 Spring Vulnerability Research at Florida Tech.

Problem 3:
Compile the below program; open in disassembler and compare source code with assembled
instructions. Examine the disassembly.

1. Can you identify the buffer overflow?
    The buffer overflow occurs in variable cUserName. gets() can write an arbitrary amount
    of bytes into cUserName, allowing the variable tfAdmin to be overwritten and changed.

2. Can you cause the overflow to happen?
    Yes, entering chars into cUserName via gets(), allows us to set a value higher than 0
    in tfAdmin.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned int IsValidUser(char* UserName);

int main(void){
    int tfAdmin = 0;
    char cUserName[8];

    printf("User Name: ");
    gets(cUserName);

    if(IsValidUser(cUserName) || tfAdmin){
        printf("You have access!\n");

    }else{
        printf("Access Denied.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

unsigned int IsValidUser(char* UserName){
    return 0;
}
